	<B><h3>IP ADDRESS:-</h3> </B><p align = "justify">An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a
	local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or
	local network.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>NUMBER OF HOST:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">A host is any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a 
	user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means. Some examples include, but are not 
	limited to, computers, personal electronic devices, thin clients, and multi-functional devices.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>NUMBER OF SUBNET:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">A subnet number is a specific part of a subnet address in an IP address that identifies one 
	among several
	subnets as the recipient or originator of a data packet.
	The subnet number helps browsers to accurately use the Internet to deliver messages to specific parts of a party's full network.</p>
	<hr><hr>
	<B><h3>SUBNET MASK:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">A subnet mask is a number that defines a rane of IP addresses availablre within a network. A single
	subnet mask
	limits the number of valid IP's for a specific
	network. A subnet mask hides (or masks) the network part of a system's IP address and leaves only the host part as the machine
	identifier.</p><hr><hr>
	<b><h3>CIDR:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) -- also known as supernetting -- is a method of assigning Internet
	Protocol 
	(IP) addresses
	that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C 
	networK.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>NETWORK ADDRESS:-</h3> </B><p align = "justify">A network address is an identifier for a node or host on a telecommunications network. 
	Network addresses 
	are designed to be unique identifiers 
	across the network, although some networks allow for local, private addresses, or locally administered addresses that may not be
	unique.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>BROADCAST ADDRESS:-</h3> </B><p align = "justify">An address that enables transmission to every node in a local network. The address is the 
	highest numeric
	value of the address format being used. An Ethernet broadcast address is all binary 1's.
	An IP broadcast address is the highest number in its class. </p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>NETWORK CLASS:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">The first step in planning for IP addressing on your network is to determine which network class
	is appropriate
	for your network. Each class uses the 32-bit IP address space differently, 
	providing more or fewer bits for the network part of the address.These classes are class A, class B, and class C.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>IMPORTANT BLOCK:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">A block is a contiguous set of bits or bytes that forms an identifiable unit of data. The term
	is used in 
	database management, word processing, and network communication.
	It is a multiple of an operating system block, which is the smallest amount of data that can be retrieved from storage or memory.
	</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>RANGE:-</h3> </b><p align = "justify">In computer programming, range refers to possible variable values or the interval that includes the upper
	and lower 
	bounds of an array. In statistics, range refers to the 
	interval between points of data. A statistic's strength and meaning correlate with the sample size, whether the range is short 
	or long.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>IP BINARY:-</h3> </B><p align = "justify">A network is a collection of devices linked together so that they may share data. Computers use the
	Binary number 
	to store digital data. However, the computer uses a different number system called Binary. Binary is a Base 2 system and uses only 
	the digits 1 and 0.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>MASK BINARY:-</h3> </B><p align = "justify">A subnet binary mask, like an IP address, is 32 bits in length.Subnet masks are composed of some 
	number of 1 bits 
	followed by enough 0 bits to form a 32-bit value. The bit positions with a 1 correspond with the bit positions in the IP address that
	are part of the network ID.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>NETWORK ADDRESS BINARY:-</h3> </B><p align = "justify">
A network is a collection of devices linked together so that they may share data. Computers use the Binary number to store digital data.
 Binary is a Base 2 system and uses only the digits 1 and 0. We call these binary digits Bits.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>BROADCAST ADDRESS BINARY:- </h3></b><p align = "justify">An address that enables transmission to every node in a local network. The address 
	is the highest 
	numeric value of the address format being used. An Ethernet broadcast address is all binary 1's. An IP broadcast address is the 
	highest number in its class; for example, the broadcast address of a Class C 192.168.16.0 network is 192.168.16.255.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>MAX NUMBER OF SUBNET:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">Maximum number of subnets = 2^6-2 =62. Note that 2 is subtracted from 2^6. The RFC 950 
	specification 
	reserves the subnet values consisting of all zeros (see above) and all ones (broadcast), reducing the number of available subnets 
	by two. Maximum number of hosts is 2^10-2 = 1022.</p><hr><hr>
	<B><h3>MAX NUMBER OF HOST:- </h3></B><p align = "justify">Maximum number of hosts is 2^10-2 = 1022. 2 is subtracted for Number of hosts is also. The 
	address with all bits
	as 1 is reserved as broadcast address and address with all host id bits as 0 is used as network address of subnet.</p><hr><Hr>
